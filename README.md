## Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves visually and statistically summarizing and interpreting data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. The "Hands on EDA" repository is a practical resource inspired by the book "Hands-On Exploratory Data Analysis with Python" by Suresh Kumar Mukhiya and Usman Ahmed.

## About the Book

"Hands-On Exploratory Data Analysis with Python" provides a comprehensive guide to EDA techniques using Python. This repository follows the book's principles and best practices, offering a hands-on approach to mastering EDA.
